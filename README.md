This is a program that implements LCA of a **binary tree**.

For example **LCA(5,6) = 1** and **LCA(8,9) = 4**.


The tasks for this assignment are:

- [x] implemetation and test code
- [x] graph structured as a binary tree
- [x] step wise development
- [x] biography of a software engineer that inspires me


Note that a test case that could not be resolved in this program is when the root node contains three child nodes. The reason being that the implementation only supports two child nodes.
